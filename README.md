A CSS color gradient is a visual effect where colors transition smoothly from one to another, creating a gradual blend. Gradients can be linear (colors flow in a straight line), radial (colors radiate from a central point), or conic (colors rotate around a central point). CSS gradients are defined using functions like linear-gradient(), radial-gradient(), and conic-gradient() and can include multiple colors, direction, and transparency for creative designs.
